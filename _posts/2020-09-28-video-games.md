As a university student, my time is limited and my budget is not very high for external activities, however, Video Games fall into a strange category in which they can be totally free or extremely expensive and they give you a range of genres that allow you to be a casual player or a hardcore fan. In this case, I have been both, a casual player with games like Dokkan Battle, Stardew Valley, Minecraft, and a hardcore fan for games like the Pokemon series, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, and Apex Legends.

You may be wondering how Video Games can be an appropriate hobby for a student that is making a serious career when they are normally associated with children and a “waste of time”, but in my experience, they have granted me a break from a monotonous and sometimes boring routine. Video Games allow me to escape to a place where my problems are irrelevant and I can forget about them for a while to just concentrate on what I have in front of me. Furthermore, they have been linked to help creative thinking, problem-solving and exercise the brain by tanking us out of our comfort zone.
